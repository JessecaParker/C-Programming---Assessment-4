# C-Programming---Assessment-4

In the first assignment, titled "u4a1 Part 1", this was the 
same assignment as assessment 3, where the grades were stored and then
outputted again. However, instead of using an array, for this one
I had to use heap memory.

In the second assignment, titled "u4a3 Part 2", I used prototype functions 
to continue the same type of assignment. There is a function to get the grades from 
the user, to get the size of the array, to print out the grades entered, to find
the average of the grades, to find the minimum of the grades, and to find the 
maximum of the grades.
